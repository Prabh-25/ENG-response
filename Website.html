      <p class="p3">Welcome to the Website, This website is one of the non-fictional text response for my MULTI-GENRE Power and Privilege and focuses on the legal powers that Canadian government have.</p> <br><br><br>

    <div class="introduction">
      <h1 class="headings1" id="intro">Introduction</h1><br>
      <p class="p1">Government is a group of people typically ranging upto hundreds of people, their main role is to take major actions and decisions for their nation/state/community. Depending on the nation they are either elected by the people of that country, they setup themselves as the dictators or work with the community. There are several more types which can be mentioned, but if we specifically talk about Canada we have federal, Parliamentary and constitutional monarchy. </p><br><br>
      <h1 class="headings2" id="functions">How does government functions?</h1><br>
      <p class="p1" >Governments have some major responsibilities towards their people, from law enforcing, healthcare, education to geopolitics and external affairs. Canadian government is divided into 3 different types of government as mentioned earlier, each serving a different purpose.<br><br> <p class="p2"><span class="bold">&#x2022; Federal government</span> is responsible for controlling and enforcing laws in each different province. Because it is at provincial level it can help solve mutual problems shared by other provinces. </p><br><br>
      <p class="p2">&#x2022; <span class="bold">Constitutional monarchy</span> is a monarch of the King or the Queen, they have limited powers due to Canadian constitution. There is a Governor General who represents the monarch and plays major roles like constitutional duties, ceremonies, honoring officials and military duties  </p><br><br>
      <p class="p2">&#x2022; <span class="bold">Parliamentary system</span> of Canada consists of House of Commons, Senate and MPs(Members of Parliament) whose main role is to pass bills, formation of government with most elected person becomes Prime Minister, holding ruling government accountable, approving budgets and national and international policies </p> </p><br><br>
      <h1 class="headings3" id="powers">What powers does government have?</h1><br>
      <p class="p1">Besides these functions and playing major roles in maintaining the nation economically and politically government also have some other powers which are divided on basis of legislative which passes laws, executive which implements them, and judicial which interprets them. Some of them include like maintaining criminal law,implementing taxes, maintaining international relations and transportation, controlling border and national security acts against terrorists.  </p><br><br>
      
      <h1 class="headings5" id="outro">Outro</h1><br>
      <p class="p1">In the end Governments are formed for people's benefit and if it does not help them live a better life than the existence of that form of government does not make more of a sense unless you live under a dictatorship. Same is expected from Canadian government to be loyal and accountable to Canadians because in the end they choose whom should sit and represents them and take decisions for them for a better present for us and a better future for coming generations</p>
